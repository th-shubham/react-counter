### Code Review and Recommendations

Commit - a0d78934dc39361941ebae62ab64da6ce9588e26

#### 1. **State Management and Side Effects**

- The way `changeCountAndDate` updates state involves derived data (`newCount` affects `newDate`), which is fine for simple cases. However, coupling state updates like this can lead to maintenance issues or bugs as the application grows.
- Consider separating concerns more clearly or using `useReducer` when state logic becomes more complex, ensuring that state transitions are predictable and centralized.

#### 2. **Date Manipulation**

- Direct manipulation of dates using `setDate` based on a counter can be error-prone due to months with different numbers of days and daylight saving time changes. For more complex date manipulations, consider using a date library like `date-fns` or `Moment.js` to handle edge cases more gracefully.
- When updating `newDate`, creating a new instance (`new Date()`) then immediately modifying it (`newDate.setDate(...)`) can lead to temporal coupling. It's better to derive the new date from the existing state directly to avoid unexpected behavior.

#### 3. **Use of IIFE for `formatDate`**

- The Immediate Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) for creating `formatDate` is unnecessary in this context since `useMemo` or `useCallback` (with an empty dependency array) could achieve the same memoization with clearer intent and leverage React's optimization.
- Example refactor using `useMemo`:
  ```javascript
  const formatDate = useMemo(() => {
  	const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US", {
  		weekday: "short",
  		year: "numeric",
  		month: "short",
  		day: "numeric",
  	});
  	return (date) => formatter.format(new Date(date));
  }, []);
  ```

#### 4. **Date Comparison in `dateTimeFormat`**

- The function `dateTimeFormat` could potentially compare dates inaccurately due to using the current time (`new Date()`) which includes hours, minutes, and seconds. For date-only comparisons, ensure both dates are normalized to the start of the day.
- Handling of timezones with `Intl.DateTimeFormat` is implicit. If handling dates across time zones is required, explicitly manage timezone information.

#### 5. **Use of React Hooks**

- Your use of hooks (`useState`) is standard. As mentioned, for more complex state logic, `useReducer` might be a cleaner approach.
- Leverage `useEffect` for any side effects that might come into play later, such as fetching data or subscriptions.

#### 6. **Accessibility and Usability**

- Adding `aria-label` attributes to buttons would improve accessibility, helping screen reader users understand the button's purpose.
- Consider user experience implications of instant state changes (e.g., rapid increases or decreases in count or step). Debouncing or confirming significant changes might enhance usability.

#### 7. **Styling and Structure**

- Inline styles (`style={{ paddingBottom: "1rem" }}`) work for quick prototyping but consider using CSS modules or styled-components for scalable applications. This promotes separation of concerns and reusability.
- The `Page` style import implies a non-standard approach to styling. Ensure consistent and scalable styling practices across your application.

#### Conclusion

Overall, the code demonstrates a solid understanding of React's basics. However, as applications grow in complexity, embracing more of React's ecosystem (hooks like `useReducer`, `useMemo`, and external libraries for date manipulation) and following best practices for maintainability, testing, and scalability becomes increasingly important. Balancing immediate simplicity with long-term maintainability is key to successful React development.
